# Kotlin widget for visualization ECG

## Introduction

The project below is a routine porting of the concept described earlier in https://github.com/mk590901/graph_widget from __dart__ to __Kotlin__. Last was selected as the source language for project.

## Implementation
The application is essentially a clone of the previously created __Java__ application https://github.com/mk590901/java_graph_widget_viewer. Naturally, some features of the Kotlin language itself were taken into account, as well as the features of the included packages. All components (classes and interfaces) of the application were rewritten in __Kotlin__, although this could not need have been done: the concept of Google allows you to freely use classes and their methods written in _Java_ and _Kotlin_ in one application. And although in real work I use a similar approach, in this case I decided not to resort to this trick. The goal was not speed implementation of project at any cost, but simply learning the language.

## Additions and changes

They are cosmetic in nature. A title and a dialog have been added to the widget in which you need to confirm the removal of the widget.
